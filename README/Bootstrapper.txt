The bootstrapper is what starts the game.

The first phase is to construct four user defined plugin sets:
    Window
    InputPlugins
    OutputPlugins
    InitialState

The output plugins and input plugins are then bound to the window.


The second phase is the construction of the main game System.
    1. Construct InputSystem given InputPlugins
    2. Construct Process System given InputSystem and InitialState
    3. Construct Output System given ProcessSystem and OutputPlugins

The third phase is launching the game
    1. Start output thread
    2. Enter main game loop
