1 Style Guide
;;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Style Guide outlines the general practices that should be followed when coding for the project. This section
includes best practices for idioms, style, documentation, and tests that appear in this project.

1.1 Java Coding Style
    All Java code should follow the conventions set forth in the Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language
(Revised April 20, 1999). Any exceptions to these conventions will be listed below.

1.1.1 Notable Exceptions
In addition, tab characters are never to appear as whitespace in code (or any other files for that matter).
Lines of code must be wrapped at 120 characters. Code documentation (JavaDocs) should still wrap at 80 characters, with
paragraph tag at that point.

1.2 Documentation
All Types, methods, and constants should be documented. Documented means that there is at least a statement of purpose
for the piece of code. Methods should also include descriptions of any the parameters and the return value.
Documentation should be clear and succinct. For some code, it may be of benefit to include examples in the
documentation.

1.3 Tests
Generally speaking complete code coverage is ideal. Realistically, achieving full coverage may not be practical or
possible. Certain pieces of code are not always practical to test. As such the following code types of code do not
necessarily require unit tests, but should have specifications for quality assurance test that can run on it.
