Phase 1 goal: Small 2D java engine + game

    1. Create Layer Interfaces. Create Base Window Interface  XX DONE

    2. For each layer, do in any order:

    Input:
      1. Develop minimal input plugin interface
      2. build input system around that interface
         Build system that binds events one to one with actions
    Process:
      1. Create State Interfaces and abstract classes
      2. build running system
    Output:
      1. Create basic output inteface
      2. build 'render' loop



    3. Create Bootstrapper
      ????

    4. Build Game:
      1. Create Keyboard plugin
      2. Create 2D Rendering Plugin
      3. Create small multi-state dick around simulator


Phase 1.5 : Code Coverage, Style Check

Phase 2 Goal: Add functionality
  1. Events -> Actions
  2. StateQueue Plugin Interface + default impl
  3. Mouse Plugin
  4. Add default recognizes for common things

Phase 3: Basic AssetCache

Future Goals:
Engine system like in vulcan
    Physics engine
    AI engine
    Scripting engine
JOGL plugin
Sound plugins
Generic AssetCache
