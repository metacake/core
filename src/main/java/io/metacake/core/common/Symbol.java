/**
 * This class is meant to be used as extensible enumerations.
 * <p>
 * All symbols are 'unique', in that they can only be compared through
 * referential equality.
 * For example :
 * public class MovementAction extends Symbol {
 *   public static final GO_UP = new MovementAction();
 *   public static final GO_DOWN = new MovementAction();
 *   public static final GO_LEFT = new MovementAction();
 *   public static final GO_RIGHT = new MovementAction();
 * }
 *
 * In this example, none of these fields can ever be equal to any other field.
 * In addition, the example type that extends Symbol could later be extended to add other
 * types to the enumeration.
